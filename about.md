I am a lone programmer, I am terrible at collabrative projects especially that includes programming. Most of my projects are the reasons to use the technology associated with that, even this blog is my first jekyll project and I'd no idea what I'm gonna post in this blog or even whether this is a blog or not. However I, it is okay until people are not aware of this, but OMG, you are here reading about me, Seriously ?.

I like to work on projects which looks much more practical from my perspective. My bad habit is that I abandone projects very often as soon as I found a better alternative like I did with PHP and then Python and then Java (in Android).

My favourite text editor is **Vim**. I haven't found any better alternative (I know about Nano and emacs if this is what you suggest!). No, not Neovim I don't get the feel in Neovim like Vim, Moreover I would have to write ``nvim`` to call neovim unless I put ``alias vim=nvim`` or ``alias vi=nvim`` in my ``~/.bashrc`` and second reason is the simplicity, Or simply I don't know why I don't use Neovim although it is forked from vim.

I'm obssesed with HP Computer Company more than any other. So come to me to hear HP-\*\*blah\*\* as my suggestion for any computer you wanna buy, Well I'm being frank about me here :p, I don't know why maybe because I could not anywhere else.

Thats enough for now.

Thanks for coming.
