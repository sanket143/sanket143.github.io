When I was a kid, I wanted to make a Social Network that out grows Facebook.
It was kind of an obsession I grew with since then. Computer wasn't even
my subject in school apparantly. I wasn't exposed to any programming tool
at all in school.

Later I found out about HTML when I was shuffling pages of my sister's
old computer books. The first thing that I created by myself was a
registration page for the social network I wanted to build. I started
learning more about it from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). (I
want to donate some money, once I earn some)

It's so common to feel frustrated when we are learning to program. I was the only
programmer in my friends circle when I started learning. It's good that
[freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) have these rooms on gitter where
I can talk and can feel motivated again to go ahead. I kept getting
better in JavaScript and became my favourite langauge because I was
stunned by the power of being able to manipulate DOM and rendering
content dynamically.

Facebook have been my all time motivation that kept me in lane. Although later
I started exploring outside the web technologies and got into command-line
tools. I developed some command-line applications for myself.

When I got my first laptop. It came with DOS, I did a minimal Ubuntu installation.
I was so much into that 2048 tiles game those days, so I created a commmand-line
version of that game in C++ for myself. I did not have enough internet speed
to download games at that time. How come I had a OS image? well I just do.

And yeah, like that I am still learning new things every day and keep
creating stuff I want.
