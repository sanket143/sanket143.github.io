I don't know. Now, it has started looking harder for me.
I am not sure anymore about [Hi](https://github.com/sanket143/hi).

Well, I saw Nom. I am really looking for is an applied examle of 
rust-nom. Well there are some examples, but are not in the way
I want. Ugh, it's 00:33 in currently. I just opened that book,
Writing an Interpreter in Go. I don't wanna go with Go.

Okay, I am thinking of doing this my way, like what I would've done
if I do not have enough resources to learn from. Build it using
what I already know, that's what I am gonna do now.
