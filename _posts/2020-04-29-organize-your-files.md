I've been to a lot of Operating Systems. Well all of 'em were linux distros
though. When we change OS more often, sometimes we regret of not backing up some
files. So I started orgnizing my files, which makes it easier for me to
know what needs to be backed up.

I've got three folders `Lite`, `Remote`, `Verts`.

`Remote`: For git repos that are remotely available like on GitHub, GitLab or Bit
 etc. We don't need a backup for this folder, cuz we will have an updated project
on GitHub or GitLab.

`Verts`: This also contains but with note remote origin to push. Like we might
have created some projects to fiddle around with some tech or so.

`Lite`: For independent files, like those we write for competitive programming.

For distros with Destktop environments, it'll be good to have these in 
`$HOME/Desktop` and for Window Managers, in `$HOME/`

And some obvious folders for `~/Music`, `~/Videos`, `~/Documents`.
