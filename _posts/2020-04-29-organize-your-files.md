I've been to a lot of Operating Systems. Well all of 'em were linux distros
though. When we do that often it, sometimes we regret of not backing up some
files and then I started orgnizing my files.

I've got three folders `Lite`, `Remote`, `Verts`.

`Remote`: For git repos that are remotely available like on GitHub, GitLab or Bit etc.

`Verts`: This also contains but with note remote origin to push. Like we might
have created some projects to fiddle around with some tech or so.

`Lite`: For independent files, like those we write for competitive programming.

For distros with Destktop environments, it'll be good to have these in 
`$HOME/Desktop` and for Window Managers, in `$HOME/`

And some obvious folders for `~/Music`, `~/Videos`, `~/Documents`.
