### Which one? Dell XPS 13!

I was very excited, for some reason, small and expensive. Why not a MacBook? Don't like to not have option to remove MacOS and I don't like MacOS. Why not use Asahi? I could've, valid option, I just got scared. I have non-Apple machines, and I keep a Windows and Linux bootable drives handy. In case I break the OS, I can just reset it. MacBook is just scary expensive, and not much to go on for me. If only Apple were a hardware company <3.

### So what's my experience like?
It's fun out here. Haven't felt missed out on anything yet. I like it here. Batter saver mode limits the resource usage, which makes the compilation slower but I don't mind it as long as I don't have to keep my machine plugged in. I don't use any x86 apps apart from perl, and I wouldn't like to use any. No gaming, that's a positive for me.

Last weekend I saw merged PRs for WOA for obs-studio.
- [obs-studio#10997][obs-studio#10997]
- [obs-studio#11846][obs-studio#11846]
- [obs-studio#12168][obs-studio#12168]

Thought I should try compiling it for my machine. And it just worked. I did have to do manual work for some dependencies but once that was done, it was just waiting-to-compile. Folks doing crazy work out there. The fact that I was even able to do that, felt good.

TBH, I'm using it more than any of my other laptops. I'm having fun in Windows Terminal. It's that bad at all. Using winget, could've been better at dependency resolving but fine.

### Bad things
- Speaker could've been better, it feels they forgot to remove a high-pass filter but I don't mind the speaker much. 
- I tried [Ubuntu concept][ubuntu-concept], as expected not ready yet, laptop was getting hot, battery draining fast
- Keyboard could've been better, not a fan of touch bar keyboard keys. MacBook (with no touch bar) has the best keyboard ngl.
- Touch screen. I even forgot that this had touch screen. I don't need it. Could've saved 30k bucks if that was an option :(
- OLED? I don't mind it. I'll be fine with IPS display as well.
- I don't mind windows any more, but still waiting for an official linux distro release for X Elite.

**Overall, I'm loving it.**
