I would like to start this blog post by Unix Philosophy. ( Oh my goodness, You know I was waiting for this moment since so long )

The idea of Unix philosophy is that You write one program and it does one thing really well.
This ideology still defines the working pipes that the output of one program could be the input of another program. [Yeah that was LOL];

Unix has been the motivation for so many Operating Systems came by. Well one of the best Operating System you might have heard of ... Mac OS X ( Oh well, that was so obvious everyone knows that! ). Well, I think then you also might have heard of Darwin, created on top of XNU kernel which end up being another recursive acronym like GNU i.e XNU is not Unix. Actually you'll get amazed by the face that the most popular version of Unix used today is Mac OS. ( Yes you heard that right ) because it came from the family [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)

Could you spot Mac OS in [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg) picture. It's the picture unix family.

Of Course, Yeah you would be like why I didn't mentioned Linux right?

I've got a reason for you. Umm.. because that is too obvious. It is so obvious that you could figure it out just by saying both words (Linux) and (Unix) one after the another.

Hah.. I'm just too lazy. Go enlighten yourself.
