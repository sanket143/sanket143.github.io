Web scraping has been my favorite tech sport. Although, it does not get considered
as a tech sport, but I love when I call it so. I felt, it'll be great to
have a language that is fully focused on web scraping and nothing else.
You know, kinda like domain specific programming language for web scraping.

Well, I'd started writing once, the name is [Hi](https://github.com/sanket143/hi).
I did when I had no idea how to write one. Even, now also I don't. I used
the book Flex and Yacc to set up some ground and yes was pretty helpful.
I am going to this again using [interpreterbook.com](https://interpreterbook.com/)
and Rust. I am really so positive about this, that this will work out well. Even
if it doesn't, I'll get to learn so much on the way. Let's see how it'll turn out.
