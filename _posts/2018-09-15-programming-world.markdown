I am gonna share an amazing way to see the real world. It is kinda perspective of the programmer who might have created this world.
What do you think about the best programmer in the Universe would have been. What define the best programmer for you ?

- The one who could create a social network in one night.
- Who could create most efficient search engine.
- Who uses C/C++ in all of his development work
- Who could create a game just by using C/C++.
- Who could create and Operating System from the base
- Who could tell any possible hardware to do anything using programming languages he knows.
- Who could teach computer to teach other computer any sort of thing.
- Who could program things which aren't actually associated with computer.
- Who could program things which aren't actaully associated with elctronics.
- How about a programmer who could program dead things (e.g Cups, Plates, Paper etc) just by using his/her computer.

Well in future somebody is gonna figure out to program each Atom movement. It seems like this is an ultimatum to do anything.
How about a programmer who could manipulate movement of an electron. Lets meet the hardest of them, the one who could program the movement of Neutron and Proton.

Let me take you to that world. Just imagine as you go to this text and note question that arises during in this world.
