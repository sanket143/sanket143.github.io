          It's fun to work with C++, that gives luxurious feel. There were some silly bugs out there since in C++, operation between two integers gives an integers. I had to convert every data type to float since the value of distance comes between 0 to 1. I took so long time to figure that out. <br><br>
          I am planning to write <strong>.cc [v8]</strong> file for nodejs addon. Since the performance demand is more where performance is low and if one would always prefer c++ over nodejs when it comes to performance.

        I'd always wished to create a real app. I've worked on Back-End more than I'd in Front-End, May that could be the reason this app has classic interface. But everyone is free to change it. After all it takes few CSS strokes.<br><br>
        It's created using electronjs.
